There is an increasing need for new data-driven approaches to solve problems in the field of Raman spectroscopy. Yet,
the lack of large, high-quality datasets has been a major bottleneck in the development and validation of new algorithms and pipelines.

To accelerate algorithmic and pipeline development, `RamanSPy` provides several big, well-curated Raman spectroscopic datasets
acquired from researchers around the world for different modelling and predictive tasks. With `RamanSPy`, users can readily
access these datasets via established data loading methods and experiment with them in a variety of applications.

Datasets are available in the `ramanspy.datasets` module.
