Loading WITec data
--------------------------------------

Users can use `RamanSPy` to load MATLAB files as exported from `WITec's Suite FIVE <https://raman.oxinst.com/products/software/witec-software-suite>`_ software.

This can be done through the :meth:`ramanspy.load.witec` method by simply providing the name of the file of interest.

.. code-block:: default

    import ramanspy


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 12-13

The method itself will parse the data to the correct spectral data container, which you can then use as usual.
